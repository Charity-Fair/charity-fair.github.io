  <h2 class="text">About:</h2>
  <p class="text2">Bread for the World is a Christian advocacy organization urging U.S. decision<br>
     makers to do all they can to pursue a world without hunger. Our mission is to<br>
      educate and equip people to advocate for policies and programs that can help end<br>
       hunger in the U.S. and around the world.</p>
  <hr>
  <p class="text2">Food banks are also essential –- but we focus on advocacy. Why? Because federal <br>
    nutrition programs provide roughly 10 times as much food assistance as private<br>
     churches and charities combined. With the stroke of a pen, our government <br>
     leaders have the power to create policies and programs that impact millions of <br>
     people at once.</p>
  <hr>
  <p class="text2">Our faith in Christ is the foundation for our mission and compels us to love our <br>
    neighbors near and far. We are led by the values of our faith to stand up for those <br>
    experiencing hunger all over.</p>

  <p class="text2">“Open your mouth for those who cannot speak, and for the rights of those who are <br>
    left without help.”-Proverbs 31:8a NLV</p>
